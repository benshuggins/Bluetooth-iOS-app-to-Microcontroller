# Bluetooth-iOS-app-to-Microcontroller
Bluetooth Low Energy application that controls a servo motor from a slider on the iphone througn BLE. The microcontoller is called the Argon particle board and it supports BLE. This is a great board for prototyping Bluetooth apps for the iphone that need to control real world peripherals, it is stable and reliable. The app has the ability to transfer data both ways, so for instance also transfer battery level powering micro back to iphone and display it on screen. I will include the c++ code that runs on the argon particle board in an entire project.
